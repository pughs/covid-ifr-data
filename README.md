### Data for estimating age-specific COVID-19 infection fatality rates in developing countries 

**IFR Data.xlsx**: contains data on seroprevalence studies, test characteristics, COVID-19 fatalities, and age distributions for 26 locations in developing countries: a subset of the locations provided in [Levin et al., 2022](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2022-008477). Fatality data and age distribution data for some locations in this data set are reported at a finer age resolution compared to the data published with Levin et al., 2022. All seroprevalence studies were conducted between June 2020 and March 2021.
